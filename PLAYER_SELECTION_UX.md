# Player Selection UX Improvements for Fixture Creation

## Changes Made

### 1. Excluded Admin Users
- Filtered out `super_admin` and `admin` roles from player selection
- These users are now automatically excluded from the player list
- Cleaner list showing only actual players

### 2. Team-Based Organization
- Players are now organized by their teams in a column layout
- Dynamic grid system adjusts based on number of teams:
  - 1-2 teams: 2 columns
  - 3 teams: 3 columns
  - 4+ teams: 4 columns on extra-large screens
- Responsive design adapts to different screen sizes

### 3. Enhanced Visual Design
- Each team displayed in a distinct gray-bordered card
- Team name as header with player count (e.g., "Team A (3/5)")
- Clean, minimal design showing only player names
- Hover effects on player rows for better interactivity

### 4. Improved Selection Features
- **Select All/Deselect All** button for each team
- Shows selected count for each team (X/Y format)
- Clear selection button to reset all selections
- Checkbox and name aligned properly with truncation for long names

### 5. Better Data Handling
- Fetches all users and filters on frontend for better control
- Organizes players by their team memberships for the selected event
- Shows "Players without team" section for unassigned players
- Maintains existing team selection UI for team-based fixtures

### 6. UX Enhancements
- Increased max height to 96 (from 64) for better visibility
- Padding inside the selection area for better spacing
- Title attributes on names for full name visibility on hover
- Smooth transitions and hover states

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface Player {
  _id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  displayName?: string;
  role?: string;
  teamMemberships?: Array<{
    teamId: string | { _id: string; name: string };
    eventId: string;
    role: string;
  }>;
}
```

### Organization Logic
1. Filter out admin users
2. Get teams for selected event
3. Initialize team map with team names
4. Iterate through players and assign to teams based on memberships
5. Create "Players without team" group for unassigned players
6. Display in responsive grid layout

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Players grouped by teams for easier selection
2. **Cleaner Interface**: Only shows player names, reducing clutter
3. **Faster Selection**: Select/deselect entire teams with one click
4. **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
5. **Improved Accessibility**: No admin users in player list
6. **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear team boundaries and player counts

## Usage

1. Select an event first
2. Choose "Players" as participant type
3. Players automatically organized by their teams
4. Use checkboxes to select individual players
5. Use "Select all" to quickly select entire teams
6. View selection count in header
7. Use "Clear selection" to reset

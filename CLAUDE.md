# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

MatchMaker Pro is a comprehensive sports fixture management system with role-based access control, built with Next.js, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The application uses Microsoft Azure AD for authentication with automatic user synchronization.

### Hierarchical Structure
The application follows an Event-Team-Player hierarchy:
- **Organization** hosts multiple **Events**
- Each **Event** contains multiple **Teams**
- Each **Team** has multiple **Players** (users)
- **Events** can have multiple **Fixtures** for sports/games
- **Fixtures** contain **Matches** between players or teams

## Development Commands

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Fixture System Architecture

1. **Same-Team Match Avoidance Algorithm**:
   - `arrangeParticipantsAvoidSameTeam()` function in `fixtures.ts`
   - Groups players by team and creates optimal pairings
   - Validates if perfect avoidance is mathematically possible
   - Falls back to best-effort arrangement when perfect avoidance impossible
   - Post-creation validation ensures no same-team matches in round 1

2. **Knockout Bracket Generation**:
   - Calculates bracket size as next power of 2: `Math.pow(2, Math.ceil(Math.log2(totalParticipants)))`
   - Determines bye count: `bracketSize - totalParticipants`
   - First round only creates matches for participants without byes
   - Bye participants automatically advance to round 2
   - Proper match linking ensures correct tournament progression
   - Handles walkovers when a match has only one participant

3. **Team Name Display in Brackets**:
   - Frontend fetches teams via `/api/teams?eventId={id}`
   - Creates `teamMap: Map<teamId, teamName>` for efficient lookups
   - `getPlayerTeamName()` helper function resolves team names
   - Team names displayed in italic gray text below player names

4. **Fixture Settings**:
   - `randomizeSeeds`: Shuffles participant order (default: true)
   - `avoidSameTeamFirstRound`: Prevents same-team matches (default: true)
   - `thirdPlaceMatch`: Adds 3rd place match for knockouts
   - Settings passed in fixture creation request body

5. **Tournament Bracket Structure**:
   - Bracket size = 2^(ceil(log2(participants))) for balanced tree
   - Bye count = bracketSize - totalParticipants
   - First round matches = (totalParticipants - byes) / 2
   - Players with byes skip round 1 and enter in round 2
   - Total rounds = ceil(log2(bracketSize))
   - Example: 10 players → 16 bracket size → 6 byes → 2 first round matches

## Important Conventions

1. **Next.js 15 Compatibility** - Use `React.use()` for async params in page components
2. **TypeScript** - Both frontend and backend use TypeScript strictly
3. **Environment Variables** - Copy `.env.example` files to `.env` files before running
4. **Git Commits** - Push to https://github.com/mudakara/fixture.git
5. **Security** - Never commit `.env` files or expose secrets
6. **Logging** - Use the logger utility for all backend logging
7. **Error Handling** - All errors should be logged and returned with appropriate HTTP status codes
8. **Ports** - Frontend runs on port 3500, Backend API runs on port 3501
9. **CORS** - Backend configured to accept requests only from http://localhost:3500
10. **Authentication Flow** - Users login via Microsoft → Backend validates token → Creates/updates user → Returns JWT
11. **Role Naming** - Roles use underscores (super_admin, vice_captain) in database
12. **File Uploads** - Multer handles image uploads for events and teams, stored in backend/uploads/
13. **Data Relationships** - Events → Teams → Players (Users) hierarchy with MongoDB references
14. **Soft Deletes** - Events, teams, and fixtures use isActive flag instead of hard deletion
15. **Image Formats** - Supported: JPEG, JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP (5MB max)
16. **Date Validation** - Event end date must be after or equal to start date
17. **Bulk Operations** - Support comma-separated values for bulk player creation
18. **Dynamic Routes** - Use consistent naming ([id] or [eventId]) to avoid conflicts
19. **Fixture Creation** - Supports `avoidSameTeamFirstRound` setting to prevent same-team matches
20. **Team Population** - Frontend fetches teams separately when teamId is not populated in responses
21. **Match Generation** - Knockout brackets use proper tournament structure with bye handling
22. **Bracket Size Calculation** - Uses next power of 2 to ensure balanced tournament tree

## Azure AD Configuration

The application uses Azure AD for authentication:
- Client ID: 79c36f11-0407-44c7-a6e2-ba48e2bdad75
- Tenant ID: 85c3bc4b-1981-4fe1-af5a-ba455eba7701
- Redirect URI: http://localhost:3500
- Authority: https://login.microsoftonline.com/common (multi-tenant)

Required API Permissions:
- User.Read
- openid
- profile
- email

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **CORS Errors**: Ensure backend .env has `CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3500`
2. **Port Already in Use**: Kill existing processes with `pkill -f nodemon` or `lsof -ti:PORT | xargs kill -9`
3. **MongoDB Connection**: Ensure MongoDB is running locally
4. **Azure AD Errors**: Check redirect URI matches exactly in Azure Portal
5. **TypeScript Errors**: Run `npm run build` in backend to check for errors
6. **localStorage Errors**: All localStorage access is wrapped with `typeof window !== 'undefined'`
7. **AuditLog Validation**: Use correct action enum values (create, update, delete, login, logout)
8. **File Upload Errors**: Ensure backend/uploads directory exists with write permissions
9. **Image Not Loading**: Configure Next.js remotePatterns for localhost:3501
10. **Team Creation Fails**: Verify captain and vice-captain are different users
11. **Next.js 15 Async Params**: Use React.use() to unwrap Promise params
12. **Dynamic Route Conflicts**: Ensure consistent folder naming in app directory
13. **Dropdown Not Closing**: Implement proper onBlur handlers with setTimeout
14. **404 After Navigation**: Use correct route paths with template literals
15. **Bulk Player Creation**: Parse "Name <email>" format correctly
16. **Fixture Routes 404**: Ensure routes are mounted correctly (e.g., `/api/fixtures` not `/api` + `/fixtures`)
17. **Tournament Bracket Logic**: Round 1 should have the most matches, decreasing towards the final
18. **Team Names Not Showing in Brackets**: Frontend creates a teamMap by fetching teams separately
19. **Same-Team Match Prevention**: Use `avoidSameTeamFirstRound` setting in fixture creation
20. **Empty Matches in Knockout**: First round creates matches only for non-bye participants
21. **Bye Handling in Tournaments**: Players with byes advance directly to round 2
22. **CSS Parsing Errors**: Avoid escaped class selectors in print styles (use attribute selectors)
23. **Print Styles Not Applying**: Use dangerouslySetInnerHTML for inline styles or global CSS
24. **Browser Print Preview Issues**: Add delay before window.print() to ensure styles load

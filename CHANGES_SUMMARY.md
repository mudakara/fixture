# Knockout Bracket Visualization Changes

## File Modified: `/frontend/app/fixtures/[id]/page.tsx`

### 1. Enhanced Positioning Algorithm (Lines 316-354)
- Added special handling for round 1 with odd participants
- Checks `previousMatchIds` to determine if match should be positioned adjacent to next round
- For odd numbers, single round 1 match aligns with its destination in round 2

### 2. Improved Line Drawing (Lines 400-425)
- Horizontal lines now start at `matchWidth - 2px` to touch card edge
- Line width extended by 2px for proper connection
- Connection dots have white border for better visibility
- Dots positioned at `matchWidth - 5px` with 10px diameter

### 3. Enhanced Bracket Connections (Lines 450-489)
- Fixed vertical line positioning for paired matches
- Lines now properly align from match center to midpoint
- Added junction dots at line intersections

### 4. L-Shaped Connections for Single Matches (Lines 491-563)
- For odd numbers, single matches use L-shaped connections
- Horizontal line extends halfway, then vertical, then horizontal to destination
- Prevents diagonal lines for cleaner appearance
- Corner dots added at turning points

### 5. Debug Logging Enhanced (Lines 273-287)
- Shows participant names and previousMatchIds
- Helps track match connections for odd number scenarios

## How to Test:
1. Create a knockout fixture with odd number of players (3, 5, 7, etc.)
2. Check that round 1 match is positioned adjacent to its round 2 destination
3. Verify lines properly connect to card edges
4. Test with even numbers to ensure standard bracket still works

## Visual Changes:
- Lines now touch cards perfectly
- Single matches align vertically with next round
- Connection dots at all junctions
- L-shaped connections for vertical alignments

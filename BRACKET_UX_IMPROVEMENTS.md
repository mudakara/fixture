# Tournament Bracket UX Improvements

## Visual Enhancements Applied

### 1. **Line Styling**
- Reduced line thickness from 3px to 2px for a cleaner look
- Changed default color from dark gray (#374151) to lighter gray (#9ca3af)
- Winner paths remain green (#10b981) for clear visual distinction
- Added smooth color transitions (300ms) when matches complete

### 2. **Rounded Corners**
- Vertical lines now have rounded ends:
  - Top-to-bottom lines: rounded bottom corners (2px radius)
  - Bottom-to-top lines: rounded top corners (2px radius)
- Creates a softer, more polished appearance

### 3. **Connection Dots**
- Reduced dot sizes for subtlety:
  - Main connection dots: 6px → 6px with refined styling
  - Junction dots: 6px → 4px for less visual weight
- Added box shadows for depth: `0 0 0 2px white, 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)`
- Winner dots have green background with light green border (#ecfdf5)
- Default dots use light gray (#d1d5db) with white border

### 4. **Match Cards**
- Enhanced shadows from `shadow-sm` to `shadow-md` for better depth
- Added gradient backgrounds:
  - Champions: Yellow gradient (from-yellow-50 to-white)
  - Completed matches: Green gradient (from-green-50 to-white)
- Hover effects now include:
  - Increased shadow (shadow-xl)
  - Subtle scale animation (1.02x)
  - Border color change to indigo-400

### 5. **Tournament Background**
- Added gradient background (from-gray-50 to-gray-100)
- Rounded corners (rounded-xl) with padding for breathing room
- Creates visual separation from page background

### 6. **Smooth Animations**
- All color changes transition smoothly (300ms duration)
- Hover states animate gracefully
- Winner path highlighting animates when results are entered

## Notes

1. **Test Data Management**: Using faker.js for realistic test data
2. **Database**: MongoDB Memory Server for isolated testing
3. **Mocking**: Need to add mocks for external services (Azure AD, email)
4. **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflow ready but not yet tested
5. **Performance**: Tests run quickly (~3s), need to maintain this

## Blockers & Issues

1. **Azure AD Mocking**: Need to implement mock for Microsoft authentication
2. **File Upload Testing**: Need to setup multer mocks for image uploads
3. **Email Service**: Need to mock email sending functionality
4. **Rate Limiting**: Need to implement test-friendly rate limiting

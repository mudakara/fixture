# Rate Limiting Fix for Fixture Creation Page

## Issue
The fixture creation page was getting a 429 (Too Many Requests) error when loading. This was caused by:
1. Making 4 parallel API requests on page load
2. Backend rate limiting set to 100 requests per 15 minutes
3. Multiple users or page refreshes quickly exhausting the rate limit

## Solution Implemented

### Frontend Changes (`app/fixtures/create/page.tsx`)

1. **Sequential Requests**: Changed from parallel to sequential API calls
   - Previously: `Promise.all([...])` made all requests simultaneously
   - Now: Each request is made one after another

2. **Added Delays**: 100ms delay between each request to spread them out
   ```typescript
   await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
   ```

3. **Loading State**: Added `dataLoading` state to show loading spinner
   - Provides visual feedback while data is being fetched
   - Prevents user confusion during the loading process

4. **Better Error Handling**: Specific handling for 429 errors
   - Shows user-friendly message for rate limit errors
   - Advises users to wait and refresh

## Backend Rate Limiting Configuration

The backend uses express-rate-limit with these defaults:
- Window: 15 minutes (900000ms)
- Max requests: 100 per window
- Applied to all `/api/` routes

## Additional Improvements Already Present

- **Fixtures List Page**: Already has 300ms debouncing for filter changes
- **Error States**: Already handles 429 errors with clear messages

## Recommendations for Production

1. Consider increasing rate limits for authenticated users
2. Implement different rate limits for different endpoints
3. Add caching for frequently accessed data (events, sport games)
4. Consider implementing a request queue for non-critical operations

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Navigate to `/fixtures/create`
2. Page should load without 429 errors
3. Loading spinner appears briefly while data loads
4. All dropdowns populate correctly
